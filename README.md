# Triangulator
Triangulator is an implementation of the Bouchitté-Todinca algorithm developed in my master's thesis [Finding Optimal Tree Decompositions](http://tuukkakorhonen.com/papers/msc-thesis.pdf).

[src/](https://github.com/Laakeri/triangulator-gradu/tree/master/src) contains the source code and the instructions to install and use Triangulator.


[experiment_data/](https://github.com/Laakeri/triangulator-gradu/tree/master/experiment_data) contains full data of the experiments conducted in the thesis.


[instances/](https://github.com/Laakeri/triangulator-gradu/tree/master/instances) contains instances of the experiments conducted in the thesis.
